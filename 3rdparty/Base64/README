detailed description
--------------------
A little class implementing base 64 encoding and decoding.
Please refer to RFC number 2045 for details on base 64 coding.
Code is based on the original GPLed work by Dawit Alemayehu and Rik Hemsley 
(KDE development team). Many changes have been made, including some optimization. 
Original version did not ignore padding-chars during decoding - see RFC 2045 ;)

history
-------
30/09/2005 - First public release

features
--------
Qt interface for quickly base 64 encoding or decoding of byte arrays. 
Supports both QByteArray and QBitArray 
Code should be endianness-aware (I'm not 100% sure, but there shouldn't be problems)

no known issues
---------------

requirements
------------
Qt version 4.0.x or later

notes
-----
The "Test files" subdirectory contains a base64 encoded file (encoded.txt) - the 
original file is decoded.png
